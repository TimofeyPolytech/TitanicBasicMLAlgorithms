In this repository, I reviewed basic ML algorithms solving the binary classification problem on the "Titanic" dataset. The following algorithms were considered:
- Random Forest;
- Logistic Regression;
- CatBoost;
- Support Vector Machine;
- Naive Bayes.
GridSearch was used to fit the parameters of each of the algorithms. The best quality metrics showed:
1) Logistic Regression;
2) Random Forest;
3) CatBoost.
